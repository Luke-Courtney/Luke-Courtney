	        Submarine Mayhem is a game created during the third-year team project of the Games Design & Development course by Luke Courtney, Ishka Yao, Adam Sheedy, Cillian Murphy.
            The objective of this project was to work as a team to create and document a game made in C++ using the SFML library that fits the theme of “Start from nothing”. 
            We started the project by brainstorming ideas for the game, and planning features and additions that we deemed to be within scope. We then moved on to developing the game. 
            We gained experience with several new things throughout the process, such as working as a team, use of Git and GitHub, and more. 
            The development period was not flawless, but we believe that we did a good job overcoming the challenges involved  in working with others to create a game and fulfil the project requirements.
